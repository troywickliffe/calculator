# calculator

Working on this calculator helped me further hone my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

HTML: Learned about the data-* global attributes => Great for JavaScript and HTML files to exchange private information.
CSS: Got more comfortable using the CSS Grid system.
JS: Got even more familiar with DOM manipulation and Event listeners.
